    "abstract": "The Thesis/Project Archiving Management System (TPAMS) is responsible to improve the consistency of the document process electronic based system. It can also minimize the accuracy of time in scanning the documents. This project is professional practice or discipline of controlling and governing what are considered the most important records of an organization throughout the records life cycle, which includes from the time such records are conceived through to their eventual disposal. This work includes identifying, classifying, prioritizing, storing, securing, archiving of records. This study proved that our algorithm is more relevant than the default MySQL method by 11.61% and has an average speed of 2.406 sec. (our search engine algorithm) versus 2.722 sec. (MySQL) when searching",

    "abstract": "The Online Archiving Thesis System (OATS) is a website that has a catalog of all the theses of graduated students from the Technological University of the Philippines Taguig (TUP-Taguig). The website will provide the title and the abstract of the study for guest users. If guest users want to access the full copy of the research, they will have to register on the website and make a payment for the thesis they want to access through a GCash API that is integrated in the website. If you are a TUP-Taguig student, you only have to register and you will be able to access the full text of the research that is created by similar or related courses and you can view it on the website or by downloading a PDF copy of the research. Only students of similar or related courses can view the full copy. The system will also have a copy-paste citation feature for users to conveniently use to cite in the study. It will be available in APA, IEEE, and MLA. Additionally, the website is going to oversee the borrowing and returning logs of the physical copy of the theses in their respective technology.",
